## orion.core.contenttype Plugin Example

This exmample defines a new type of image file type for Encapsulated Post Script (EPS) images. It does not have a direct effect on the Orion UI, but can be referred to by other services that need to associate themselves with a particular kind of file.

Please see the [Edit Editor](../Edit\ Editor/plugin_installer.html) and [Core Content Type](../Navigator\ Open\ With/plugin_installer.html) extension points for more information

To install, add the _plugin_installer.html_ from this directory as a plugin to your Orion client.

For more information please see the [Eclipse Orion Developer Guide](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Orion/Documentation/Developer_Guide/Plugging_into_the_editor#orion.core.contenttype).
