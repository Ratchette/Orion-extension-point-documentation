	<h1>[Plugin Name] Example Editor Highlighter Plugin</h1>

	<p id="description">
		[Describe what your plugin does] 
		
		The orion.edit.highlighter service contributes syntax highlighting rules to the editor. A highlighter service may provide highlighting in one of two ways:
		<ul>
    		<li>
    		By passing a grammar, which is a declarative description of a language's syntax. The grammar tells the Orion editor how to recognize and style language constructs in a file.
    		</li>
    		
    		<li>
    		By writing a highlighter, which allows highlighting information to be calculated asynchronously by the provider itself and sent to the Orion editor for display.
    		</li>
		</ul>

    The service also provides a list of content types. When the editor opens a file of a registered content type, the provider is invoked (using one of the two methods described above) to obtain the styling.
    
    <br />
    
    NOTE: The "highlighter" API is experimental and subject to change in future versions.
    
    <br />
    
    Orion invokes this method to inform the provider what kind of file it must provide highlighting for. This allows the provider that to register itself with several content types, but implement different logic for each type.
    
    <br />
    
    When this provider's type is "grammar", no service methods are defined: a grammar provider is purely declarative.
