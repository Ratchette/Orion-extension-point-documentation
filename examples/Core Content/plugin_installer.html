	<p id="description">
		[Describe what your plugin does]
		The orion.core.content service is used to define files that can be imported into a user's project folder. The service describes a contentURITemplate that can be imported into a folder. If the content is a zip file, it can be unzipped into the folder. If the content is to be generated by simply linking to another page, a uriTemplate can be used to specify the link instead of a contentURITemplate.

The user interface for this feature is not specified. The ability to generate content into a project may appear in multiple places.<br />

		Here is a sample plug-in that defines a content zip file that is colocated with the Orion plugin. When this plug-in is installed, the user will be offered "Another Exemplary Sample Site" as possible content for a project.
