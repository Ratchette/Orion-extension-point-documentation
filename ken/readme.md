## orion.edit.contentAssist Plugin Example

This example shows how to use the orion.edit.contentAssist service to add simple content assist to JavaScript files. The JavaScript support in Orion already has JavaScript content assist so these will be added in addition to the ones already there.

To install, add the _plugin_installer.html_ from this directory as a plugin to your Orion client.

For more information please see the [Eclipse Orion Developer Guide](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Orion/Documentation/Developer_Guide/Plugging_into_the_editor#orion.edit.contentAssist).
