## orion.edit.editor Plugin Example

This example shows how to use the orion.edit.contentAssist editor to create a new editor object. It has no functionality on its own, and must be instead combined with other extension points. 

This example is Susan McCourt's plugin and allows integration with Pixlr, the online image editor.

To install, add the _plugin_installer.html_ from this directory as a plugin to your Orion client.
