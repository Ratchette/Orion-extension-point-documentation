	<h1>[Plugin Name] Example Navigator Open With Plugin</h1>

	<p id="description">
		[Describe what your plugin does] 
		The orion.navigate.openWith service is used to associate a registered editor with a registered content type. Once this association has been made, the editor will be presented as a choice in the actions menu (gear menu) beside files of that content type. (If it's the only available editor for that file, it will be used to generate the link when the file is clicked).  <br />

By default, the Orion client UI provides an editor with ID orion.editor, to be used for editing source code. You can refer to this editor ID when you want to associate a new content type with the Orion Editor. <br />

		This example works in conjunction with the Core Content Type and Edit Editor examples to integrate Orion with Pixlr, the online image editor. This extension point is used to associate the pixlr editor with the content types representing images.
